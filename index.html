        <h1>COVID-19 GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TRACKER</h1>
        <p>
            Governments are taking a wide range of measures in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. 
            This tool aims to track and compare policy responses around the world, rigorously and 
            consistently.

    <h1>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h1>
    <p>The Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) collects systematic information on policy measures that governments have taken to tackle COVID-19. The different policy responses are tracked since 1 January 2020, cover more than 180 countries and are coded into 23 indicators, such as school closures, travel restrictions, vaccination policy. These policies are recorded on a scale to reflect the extent of government action, and scores are aggregated into a suite of policy indices. The data can help decision-makers and citizens understand governmental responses in a consistent way, aiding efforts to fight the pandemic. Our core working paper (BSG-WP-2020/032) provides more information on methodology and data collection.</p>
